# About Me

Hi there! I'm Sadia, a passionate designer and technology enthusiast. I have a deep love for UX designing, problem-solving, and creating innovative digital solutions. With a strong background in User experience and a curiosity for exploring new technologies, I'm always excited to embark on new projects and challenges.

## Background and Experience

I began my journey in the world of Designing during my high school years, where I honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and wireframing. Since then, I've expanded my expertise to also include various front-end and back-end technologies, such as:

- **Front-End Development**: I'm skilled in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces using modern front-end frameworks.

- **Back-End Development**: I have experience working with server-side technologies like Node.js and Express and scalable APIs.


## My Approach

I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and continuous learning. I'm an advocate for writing clean and maintainable code, and I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams to bring ideas to life. My goal is to create digital experiences that not only meet functional requirements but also provide an enjoyable and seamless user journey.

## Hobbies and Interests

When I'm not designing, I love to read books and lidten to music and i really do love to draw. Whether it's hiking in the mountains / exploring new restaurants / playing musical instruments, I find that my diverse interests fuel my creativity and keep me inspired.
